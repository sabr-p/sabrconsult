                    <p>You authorize SabrConsult support staff to log in over SSH protocol to your computing instances and perform configuration and maintenance tasks. This can be done when a) you ask for support, b) when suspicious activity detected on your instance, that may damage or interrupt SabrConsult system operations, data or instances of other SabrConsult clients.</p>
                    <p>If you do not wish to authorize access to your computing instances, you must send a notice to <a href="mailto:support@SabrConsult.com" target="_blank">support@SabrConsult.com </a></p>

                    <h1>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>
                    <h2>Cancellation</h2>
                    <p>To unsubscribe from SabrConsult, login to your account and click on <strong> Billing </strong> in the <strong> User </strong> menu (second icon from the right in the top navigation bar). In the billing window, click on the <strong> [Change] </strong> link next to your current plan. Finally, select <strong> Unsubscribe </strong> from the icons that pop up.</p>
                    <p>Once cancelled, your account will remain active until the next due date.</p>
                    <p>Past the due date, if no payment has been received, your account will be deactivated. You will no longer be able to log in to the SabrConsult control panel and your instances, farms, and applications will no longer be controlled by SabrConsult. However, no instances are terminated upon service cancellation, so they will continue to run, unless you terminate them.</p>
                    <h2>Refunds</h2>
                    <p>No refunds can be made, neither for full nor for partial month periods.</p>
